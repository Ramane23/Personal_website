# Portfolio Website Development Log

This document tracks every step of building your AI/ML portfolio website, explaining what each file does and why we make each decision.

---

## Phase 1: Project Initialization

### Step 1: Configuration Files Created

#### 1.1 package.json
**What it is**: Like `requirements.txt` in Python projects - lists all the JavaScript libraries (packages) your project needs.

**Why we need it**:
- Defines project name, version, and scripts
- Lists dependencies (libraries) to install
- Allows others to recreate your environment with `npm install`

**Key dependencies explained**:
- `next` (v15.0.0): The Next.js framework - think of it like Flask or FastAPI but specifically designed for React websites
- `react` & `react-dom`: The core libraries for building user interfaces with reusable components
- `framer-motion`: Animation library for smooth, professional animations
- `typescript`: Adds type checking to JavaScript (like Python type hints but enforced)
- `tailwindcss`: CSS framework that lets you style components using utility classes instead of writing custom CSS

**Scripts explained**:
- `npm run dev`: Starts development server (like `flask run` or `uvicorn main:app`)
- `npm run build`: Creates optimized production version
- `npm start`: Runs the production build
- `npm run lint`: Checks code quality

---

#### 1.2 tsconfig.json
**What it is**: Configuration for TypeScript compiler.

**Why we need it**:
- Tells TypeScript how to compile your code
- Enables strict type checking (catches errors before runtime)
- Configures path aliases (`@/*` means you can import from project root)

**Key settings**:
- `strict: true`: Enforces type safety (like using mypy with strict mode)
- `paths: {"@/*": ["./*"]}`: Allows cleaner imports like `import X from '@/components/Y'`
- `jsx: "preserve"`: Handles React's JSX syntax (HTML-like code in JavaScript)

---

#### 1.3 tailwind.config.ts
**What it is**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS styling framework.

**Why we need it**:
- Defines your design system (colors, fonts, spacing)
- Enables dark mode support
- Customizes the default Tailwind theme to match your brand

**Key customizations**:
- `darkMode: 'class'`: Enables dark mode toggle (adds/removes 'dark' class)
- `colors.primary`: Your main color palette (blue shades) - used for headings, buttons, highlights
- `colors.accent`: Accent color (cyan) - used for call-to-action buttons and interactive elements
- `fontFamily.sans: ['Inter']`: Modern, clean font for text (like Arial but more professional)
- `fontFamily.mono: ['JetBrains Mono']`: Monospace font for code snippets

**Color scheme rationale**:
- Primary blues/purples: Professional, tech-forward, associated with AI/ML
- Accent cyan: High contrast, draws attention to important actions
- Dark navy background: Easy on eyes, makes content pop

---

#### 1.4 postcss.config.js
**What it is**: Configuration for PostCSS, which processes your CSS.

**Why we need it**:
- Enables Tailwind CSS to work
- Autoprefixer adds browser compatibility prefixes automatically

**Simple explanation**: Think of it as a preprocessor that makes your CSS work across all browsers.

---

#### 1.5 next.config.js
**What it is**: Next.js framework configuration.

**Why we need it**:
- Controls how Next.js builds and serves your site
- `reactStrictMode: true`: Enables additional development checks (finds potential bugs)

---

#### 1.6 .eslintrc.json
**What it is**: ESLint configuration for code quality checking.

**Why we need it**:
- Like `pylint` or `flake8` for Python
- Catches common mistakes and enforces code style
- `next/core-web-vitals`: Uses Next.js recommended rules for performance

---

## Phase 2: Project Structure Setup

### Next Steps (To Be Completed):

#### 2.1 Create Directory Structure
We'll create these folders:
```
app/          - Next.js pages (like Flask routes)
components/   - Reusable UI pieces (like React components)
lib/          - Utility functions and data
  └── data/   - Your content (projects, experience, skills)
public/       - Static files (images, CV PDF)
```

**Why this structure**:
- `app/`: Next.js 14 uses "App Router" - each folder can be a page
- `components/`: Keep UI code organized and reusable
- `lib/data/`: Separate content from code (easy to update without touching components)
- `public/`: Files here are served directly (like Flask's static folder)

---

## Phase 3: Data Files (Your Portfolio Content)

We'll create TypeScript files that contain all your information:

### 3.1 projects.ts
Will contain your 4 main projects:
1. Real-Time Contrails Prediction System
2. AI-Powered Blog Generator Agent
3. AI Chatbots - Agentic AI
4. HomeMatch - RAG-Based Real Estate

**Why separate files**: You can update your projects without touching the component code. Like having a config file vs application logic.

### 3.2 experience.ts
Your work history:
- Akkodis Research (current)
- Liebherr Aerospace

### 3.3 skills.ts
Your tech stack organized by ML workflow stages (8 categories)

### 3.4 education.ts
Degrees and certifications

---

## Phase 4: Component Development

Components are reusable UI pieces. Think of them like Python functions that return HTML.

### Components we'll build:

1. **Navigation.tsx**: Fixed header with links and dark mode toggle
2. **Hero.tsx**: Landing section with your name, title, photo
3. **About.tsx**: Professional summary
4. **Experience.tsx**: Work timeline
5. **Projects.tsx**: Project cards in a grid
6. **Skills.tsx**: Tabbed interface for tech skills
7. **Education.tsx**: Degrees and certifications
8. **Contact.tsx**: Contact information and links
9. **Footer.tsx**: Bottom section with links

**Why components**:
- Reusable (write once, use anywhere)
- Maintainable (change in one place, updates everywhere)
- Testable (can test each piece independently)

---

## Phase 5: Styling Approach

### Tailwind CSS Utility Classes
Instead of writing CSS files, we'll use Tailwind classes directly in components.

**Example**:
```jsx
// Traditional CSS approach:
<div className="hero-section">  // Then write .hero-section in CSS file

// Tailwind approach:
<div className="bg-blue-900 text-white p-8 rounded-lg">
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster development (no switching between files)
- Consistent design (uses your theme)
- Responsive built-in (`md:text-lg` means "large text on medium+ screens")
- Dark mode easy (`dark:bg-gray-800` means "dark gray background in dark mode")

---

## Phase 6: Dark Mode Implementation

We'll use a React context (like global state) to manage dark/light mode:

1. User clicks toggle button
2. JavaScript adds/removes 'dark' class on `<html>` element
3. All `dark:` Tailwind classes activate/deactivate
4. Preference saved in browser localStorage

**Why this approach**:
- No page refresh needed
- Persists across sessions
- Follows user's system preference by default

---

## Phase 7: Responsive Design

Mobile-first approach using Tailwind breakpoints:

- Default styles: Mobile (320px+)
- `sm:`: Small tablets (640px+)
- `md:`: Tablets (768px+)
- `lg:`: Laptops (1024px+)
- `xl:`: Desktops (1280px+)

**Example**:
```jsx
<div className="text-2xl md:text-4xl lg:text-6xl">
  // Small text on mobile, larger on tablets, largest on desktop
</div>
```

---

## Phase 8: Animations

Using Framer Motion for smooth animations:

1. **Fade-in on scroll**: Elements appear as you scroll down
2. **Hover effects**: Cards lift slightly when you hover
3. **Typing animation**: Hero tagline types out letter by letter
4. **Smooth transitions**: Dark mode toggle, page navigation

**Why Framer Motion**:
- Easy to use (declarative API)
- Performance optimized
- Professional results

---

## Phase 9: SEO Optimization

Making your site discoverable by Google:

1. **Meta tags**: Title, description, Open Graph tags (for social media previews)
2. **Semantic HTML**: Using proper tags (`<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)
3. **Structured data**: JSON-LD schema for your professional info
4. **sitemap.xml**: List of all pages for search engines
5. **robots.txt**: Instructions for search engine crawlers

---

## Phase 10: Deployment to Vercel

Vercel is like Heroku but specialized for Next.js:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Vercel automatically builds and deploys
4. Every push to main branch triggers new deployment
5. Free SSL certificate included
6. Global CDN (fast loading worldwide)

**Why Vercel**:
- Made by Next.js creators (best compatibility)
- Free tier perfect for portfolios
- Automatic HTTPS
- Easy custom domain setup

---

## Design Decisions Summary

### Color Palette
- **Primary (Deep Blue)**: Professional, trustworthy, tech-forward
- **Accent (Cyan)**: Eye-catching, modern, energetic
- **Dark Background**: Reduces eye strain, looks sophisticated

### Typography
- **Inter font**: Clean, modern, excellent readability
- **JetBrains Mono**: Perfect for code snippets (what developers use)

### Layout
- **Single-page application**: All content on one page, smooth scrolling between sections
- **Fixed navigation**: Always accessible, never get lost
- **Card-based design**: Modern, scannable, works well on mobile

### Performance Targets
- **Lighthouse score 90+**: Google's performance benchmark
- **< 2 second load time**: Users leave if page is slow
- **Optimized images**: Lazy loading, modern formats (WebP)

---

## 🎯 PROGRESS UPDATE

### ✅ COMPLETED: Phase 1 - Project Initialization

**What was done**:
1. ✅ Created all configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, etc.)
2. ✅ Ran `npm install` - Downloaded 445 packages successfully (0 vulnerabilities)
3. ✅ Created folder structure (app/, components/, lib/data/, public/)

**Files created in Phase 1**:
- `package.json` - Dependencies list (like requirements.txt)
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Your custom theme (colors, fonts)
- `postcss.config.js` - CSS processing
- `next.config.js` - Next.js settings
- `.eslintrc.json` - Code quality rules

---

### ✅ COMPLETED: Phase 2 - Data Files Creation

Created all portfolio content in `lib/data/`:

#### 1. `projects.ts` ✅
- Your 4 main projects with full details
- Includes metrics, tech stacks, GitHub links
- Helper functions for filtering

#### 2. `experience.ts` ✅
- Akkodis Research (current)
- Liebherr Aerospace (previous)
- Achievements and tech stacks for each

#### 3. `skills.ts` ✅
- 8 categories organized by ML workflow
- 60+ technologies listed
- From Data Ingestion → CI/CD

#### 4. `education.ts` ✅
- 7 degrees/programs
- 3 certifications (2 AWS + Scrum)
- Status tracking for each

#### 5. `personal.ts` ✅
- Name, title, tagline, contact info
- Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn)
- SEO metadata
- Professional summary

**Why separate data files?**: You can update your portfolio content without touching any component code! Just edit the data files.

---

### ✅ COMPLETED: Phase 3 - Styling & Theme Setup

#### 1. `app/globals.css` ✅
**Purpose**: Global styles for the entire site

**What it includes**:
- Tailwind CSS imports
- Dark/light mode color scheme
- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Custom scrollbar (matches your theme)
- Animations (fade-in, typing effect)

**Key features**:
```css
/* Dark mode styles activate when 'dark' class is on <html> */
dark:bg-gray-900  /* Dark background in dark mode */
dark:text-gray-100 /* Light text in dark mode */
```

#### 2. `lib/theme-context.tsx` ✅
**Purpose**: Manages dark mode state across entire site

**How it works**:
1. Creates React Context (global state container)
2. Provides `toggleTheme()` function
3. Saves preference to localStorage (persists between visits)
4. Auto-detects system preference on first load

**For Python devs**:
- Like a singleton pattern managing global state
- `useEffect` = code that runs on component mount (like `__init__`)
- `localStorage` = browser storage (like saving to a file)
- `'use client'` = this code runs in browser, not server
